Synopsis:  
My school actually adopted an SEL tool that would alert administration about “red flag” digital student behavior.  The tool was abandoned after a staff discussion about privacy and the need to use the funds for prevention and mental health counseling with professionals  rather than the technology.  
Digital surveillance tools are used to detect if students are at risk of harming themselves or others.  These tools have been increasingly used by schools since the pandemic.  Gaggle is an example of such a tool that claims it saved 1,408 lives last year by using algorithms and humans to scan students’ digital activity and collect and pass alerts to schools.  These tools and the research on their effectiveness are new and emerging.  The concerns are:   false alerts, student and family privacy, equity (poor students are more likely to be surveilled) and authentic mental  health services.
